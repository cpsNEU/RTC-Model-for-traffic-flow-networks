# RTC-Model-for-traffic-flow-networks
RTC code for traffic flow networks
The RTC model is coded by matlab.
The file named mainFxied-Time is executed to build a RTC model for the dual-way urban traffic flow network controled by the fixed time strategy.
The file named mainAdapted is executed to build the model for the dual-way urban traffic flow network controled by the adaptive strategy.
The file named mainLaneFxied-Time is executed to build a RTC model for the lane urban traffic flow network controled by the fixed time strategy.
The file named mainLaneAdapted is executed to build the model for the lane urban traffic flow network controled by the adaptive strategy.
