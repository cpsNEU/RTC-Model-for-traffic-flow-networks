# RTC-Model-for-traffic-flow-networks
RTC code for traffic flow networks
The RTC model is coded by matlab.
The file named mainFxied-Time is executed to build a RTC model for an urban traffic flow network controled by the fixed time strategy.
The file named mainAdapted is executed to build the model for the urban traffic flow network controled by the adaptive strategy.
